        <h1>What is Motherhood?</h1>
        <p>Being a mom means more than having given birth to a child. It's loving and knowing a soul before you even see it. It's carrying and caring for a life completely dependant on you for survival. It's giving air to the lungs that grew within you, and sight to the eyes that will never see you as anything but mommy. It's sleepless nights, its nursing scratches and scrapes, it's being stern and protective. It's teaching them to talk, to walk and to eventually run. It's learning to hand your child to a stranger to let them teach what you cannot at times. It's bracing them for a fall, and dusting them off after they do. It's seeing them cry and not knowing how to fix it, so you sit on the floor and hold them and cry right along beside them. It's teaching them that they are smart, capable, funny and giving them the security to do great things. It's building their self-esteem, supporting their dreams and loving them unconditionally. It's letting them go, letting them fail and teaching them how to get back up. It's going without so that they don't have to, and being OK with it.</p>
        <h1>Motherhood is hard</h1>
        <p>Being a mom can be tough. In fact, as the saying goes, if you don’t find it hard sometimes, you may not be paying attention. But it can also be rewarding. 
            <em>Here’s why it’s a challenge and how to find happiness through all the ages and stages of being a mom.</em>
        </p>
        <h2>All Moms Work</h2>
        <p>It’s important to point out that all moms work, whether they’re getting paid by an employer or not. Mothering takes effort—physical, mental and emotional—so whether or not we have a paid position, we can pat ourselves on the back at the end of the day for a job well done.</p>
        <h2>Your Labor</h2>
        <p>Motherhood can also be stressful because of the kind of work it entails. Moms are also more likely to work a “second shift” in which they work for pay all day, and then perform home-work in the evening. In addition, the type of work moms perform tends to be different than dads’ work.</p>
